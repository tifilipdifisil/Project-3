## Notes for instructor
*Prof Buck the only challenge with P3 is that I have been having an hard time with validating my code with the markup validation service. I tried to validate it via both by URI sorry this document cannot be checked no host option provided and by direct input it doesn’t recognize the blade syntax. It’s partially my fault I should taking care of that sooner but I you could shed some light it will be appreciated for P4*
